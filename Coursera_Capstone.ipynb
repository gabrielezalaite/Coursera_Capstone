    "Business problem: \n",
    "There is a family that wants to open a family run authentic Japanese restaurant in Toronto. They are not a chain and are going for the loyal reliable customer base rather than flashy tourist attraction. They want to open a restaurant in a relatively high population density area first and somewhere where there isn’t a lot of similar competition and then where there isn’t a lot of other restaurants either considering that they think that this will increase their chances to gain customers if they aren’t spoiled for choice. They want a local supply of staples in Japanese cuisine such as fish, as these tend to go off rather quickly so ideally, they will want a nearby fresh fish market.  If there is a fresh food market in all of their top regions then amount of popular attractions will be considered as the final deciding factor.\n",

    "1.\tAccess to local fishing docks/fish market \n",
    "2.\tPopulation density- to target loyal clientele that will come back, not tourists\n",

    "4.\tAmount of all restaurants in the area\n",
